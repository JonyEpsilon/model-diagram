# Model diagram

Run `lein figwheel` and then visit http://localhost:3449 . Changing the `example-model` in
`model-diagram.core` should (via figwheel) update the diagram. Haven't figured out how to
send data the other way with Om yet to update the diagram from a control on the page.

You can also `lein gorilla` if you want to look at the worksheet (model-shape.clj).
